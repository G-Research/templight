/**
 * \brief Reparse the source files that produced this translation unit.
 *
 * This routine can be used to re-parse the source files that originally
 * created the given translation unit, for example because those source files
 * have changed (either on disk or as passed via \p unsaved_files). The
 * source code will be reparsed with the same command-line options as it
 * was originally parsed. 
 *
 * Reparsing a translation unit invalidates all cursors and source locations
 * that refer into that translation unit. This makes reparsing a translation
 * unit semantically equivalent to destroying the translation unit and then
 * creating a new translation unit with the same command-line arguments.
 * However, it may be more efficient to reparse a translation 
 * unit using this routine.
 *
 * \param TU The translation unit whose contents will be re-parsed. The
 * translation unit must originally have been built with 
 * \c clang_createTranslationUnitFromSourceFile().
 *
 * \param num_unsaved_files The number of unsaved file entries in \p
 * unsaved_files.
 *
 * \param unsaved_files The files that have not yet been saved to disk
 * but may be required for parsing, including the contents of
 * those files.  The contents and name of these files (as specified by
 * CXUnsavedFile) are copied when necessary, so the client only needs to
 * guarantee their validity until the call to this function returns.
 * 
 * \param options A bitset of options composed of the flags in CXReparse_Flags.
 * The function \c clang_defaultReparseOptions() produces a default set of
 * options recommended for most uses, based on the translation unit.
 *
 * \returns 0 if the sources could be reparsed.  A non-zero error code will be
 * returned if reparsing was impossible, such that the translation unit is
 * invalid. In such cases, the only valid call for \c TU is
 * \c clang_disposeTranslationUnit(TU).  The error codes returned by this
 * routine are described by the \c CXErrorCode enum.
